# Modernized Gavel simulator dependencies for macOS
# Original: src/scheduler/requirements.txt
# Tested working on Python 3.9.6 / macOS

# Core - LP solver and numerics
cvxpy>=1.4
ecos  # ECOS solver for cvxpy
numpy>=1.24
scipy>=1.10

# Data handling and visualization
pandas>=2.0
matplotlib>=3.7
seaborn>=0.12

# Utilities
dill
filelock
func_timeout
glog
psutil
setproctitle
preconditions

# ML utilities (updated from sklearn)
scikit-learn

# Image processing (may be needed for some workloads)
pillow
opencv-python

# Required for scheduler (discovered during setup)
matrix_completion
grpcio
grpcio-tools

# Skipped for simulation-only:
# - torch, torchvision (only needed for workload profiling, not simulation)
# - numa (Linux-only, not needed for simulation)
# - gym, gym[atari] (RL policies only)
# - annoy (approximate nearest neighbors, likely not needed)
